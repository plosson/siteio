# siteio Brand Briefing

## Brand Essence

**One-liner:** Deploy static sites to your own infrastructure with a single command.

**Brand Position:** The self-hosted alternative to Vercel and Netlify for developers who want ownership without complexity.

**Core Promise:** You get the deployment experience of modern PaaS platforms, but on infrastructure you control.

## Brand Personality

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Confident** | We don't apologize for being simple. Simple is the feature. |
| **Direct** | No marketing fluff. Commands do what they say. |
| **Empowering** | Your server. Your domain. Your rules. |
| **Technical** | We speak developer. No dumbing down. |

### Tone Guidelines

- **DO:** Use active voice. Be specific. Show, don't tell.
- **DO:** Reference real workflows developers know.
- **DON'T:** Use enterprise jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "solution").
- **DON'T:** Over-promise or hype. Under-promise, over-deliver.

## Target Audience

### Primary: The Indie Developer

- Runs side projects on a $5/mo VPS
- Values ownership over convenience
- Comfortable with the terminal
- Skeptical of platform lock-in
- Ships fast, iterates faster

### Secondary: The Pragmatic Engineer

- Needs to spin up demos and previews quickly
- Manages internal tools and documentation sites
- Wants automation without vendor dependencies
- Prefers tools that "just work"

---

## Key Messages

### Hierarchy of Messages

1. **Deploy in seconds** — `siteio sites deploy ./folder` and you're live
2. **Own your infrastructure** — Runs on any VPS. No vendor lock-in.
3. **HTTPS by default** — Automatic Let's Encrypt. Zero config.
4. **One binary, no dependencies** — Download, run, done.

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "siteio is a CLI that deploys static sites to your own server. You run an agent on your VPS, and from anywhere you can `siteio deploy` a folder to get a live HTTPS subdomain in seconds. It's like Vercel, but self-hosted—no accounts, no limits, no lock-in."

### Tagline Options

- **"Your server. Your sites. One command."**
- **"Self-hosted static sites, the easy way."**
- **"Deploy without the platform."**

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Position | Our Differentiation |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Vercel | Best DX for frontend teams | We're self-hosted. No vendor. No limits. |
| Netlify | JAMstack for everyone | Same simplicity, but you own the infra. |
| Surge | Quick CLI deploys | We support your own domain + wildcard subdomains. |
| rsync + nginx | DIY deployment | We handle HTTPS, routing, and management. |

**Position Statement:**
> For developers who want fast static site deploys without surrendering control, siteio provides a self-hosted deployment agent with the convenience of a modern CLI. Unlike Vercel or Netlify, you host it yourself—no accounts, no surprise bills, no platform decisions forced on you.

| Success | `#2da44e` (Green) | Deploy success, confirmation |
| Background | `#ffffff` | Clean, professional base |
| Text | `#1f2328` | High contrast for readability |
| Muted | `#656d76` | Secondary text, descriptions |

- **Body:** System fonts for performance

### Logo Concept

The "S" mark with a gradient (blue → green) represents:
- **Simplicity** — A single letter, not a complex icon
- **Progress** — Gradient suggests movement, deployment flow
- **Technical** — Geometric, not decorative

---

## Naming Conventions

### Product Names

- **siteio** (lowercase) — The product and CLI command
- **siteio agent** — The server component
- **siteio.me** — The domain and brand

### Feature Naming

Keep it plain:
- "deploy" not "ship" or "publish"
- "sites" not "projects" or "apps"
- "agent" not "daemon" or "service"

## Content Strategy

### Website

- Lead with the install command (developers want to try, not read)
- Show real terminal output (authenticity > polish)
- Three steps max in any "how it works" section

### Documentation

- Start every page with a working command
- Avoid theory—show practical examples
- Include copy-paste snippets

### Social/Community

- Share real use cases (portfolios, docs sites, demos)
- Engage with self-hosting communities (r/selfhosted, HN)
- Celebrate simplicity as a feature
